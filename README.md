# <center>Clustering</center>
Clustering is a type of Unsupervised learning. This is very often used when you donâ€™t have labeled data. K-Means Clustering is one of the popular clustering algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to find groups(clusters) in the given data. In this post we will implement K-Means algorithm using Python from scratch.

# K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a very simple algorithm which clusters the data into K number of clusters. The following image from PyPR is an example of K-Means Clustering.
